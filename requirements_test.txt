# Pygame is needed as PygameAudioBackend is tested and imports pygame.
# Numpy is included as it was previously added for pygame.sndarray or other test needs.
pygame==2.6.1
numpy>=1.26.0

# RPi.GPIO is included as modules under test might import it.
# If your CI environment cannot install RPi.GPIO, or if all imports are
# robustly mocked (e.g., via sys.modules patching in conftest.py before
# application module imports), this could potentially be removed or replaced
# with a mock package like 'fake-rpi'.
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0

# python-socketio[client] is retained if tests specifically act as a Socket.IO client.
# The base 'python-socketio' is already included via requirements_base.txt.
