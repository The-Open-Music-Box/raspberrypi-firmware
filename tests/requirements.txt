# Core testing framework
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.18.0

# Pygame is needed as PygameAudioBackend is tested and imports pygame.
# Numpy is included as it was previously added for pygame.sndarray or other test needs.
pygame==2.6.1
numpy>=1.26.0

# RPi.GPIO is included as modules under test might import it.
# If your CI environment cannot install RPi.GPIO, or if all imports are
# robustly mocked (e.g., via sys.modules patching in conftest.py before
# application module imports), this could potentially be removed or replaced
# with a mock package like 'fake-rpi'.
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0

# python-socketio[client] is retained if tests specifically act as a Socket.IO client.
# The base 'python-socketio' is already included via requirements_base.txt.
python-socketio[client]>=5.11.1

# Note: Adafruit CircuitPython libraries (bh1750, pn532) and rpi_ws281x
# were previously considered but are omitted here on the assumption that
# modules using them are either not tested in a way that requires these
# packages to be importable, or that their imports are effectively mocked
# at a level that doesn't require the packages themselves.
# If ImportErrors occur for these during testing, they may need to be added
# or a pre-import mocking strategy implemented in conftest.py.
