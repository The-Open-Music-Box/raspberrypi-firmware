Regression tests for NFC association broadcasting bug.

These tests specifically target the bug that was fixed where NFC association
events weren't being broadcasted to the frontend via Socket.IO.

🐛 Original Bug:
- NFC association dialog appeared when starting association
- Tag scanning worked in backend (domain logic correct)
- But dialog never received confirmation events
- Dialog remained stuck in "waiting" state

🔧 Root Cause:
- NfcApplicationService._handle_tag_detection() didn't trigger association callbacks
- Application._on_nfc_association_event() didn't broadcast Socket.IO events

These tests ensure this specific bug never happens again.
