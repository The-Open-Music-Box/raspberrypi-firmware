End-to-End Integration Test: Playlists Snapshot via WebSocket

This test ensures that when clients subscribe to the 'playlists' room via WebSocket,
they receive actual playlist data from the database, not an empty snapshot.

Critical Bug Prevented:
- StateSnapshotApplicationService missing data_application_service dependency
- Clients receiving empty playlists array despite database having data
- Frontend showing "No playlists found" when playlists exist
