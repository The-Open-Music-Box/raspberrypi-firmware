# Raspberry Pi specific requirements for GPIO
# Use this instead of lgpio on older Raspberry Pi OS versions

# GPIO libraries (in order of preference)
RPi.GPIO==0.7.1  # Most compatible with older systems
gpiozero==2.0.1  # Already in base.txt but ensure it's installed
pigpio==1.78  # Optional, provides more advanced features

# Remove lgpio from requirements as it needs newer GLIBC
# lgpio is replaced by RPi.GPIO for better compatibility
